# week5-azatseyrek (typescript and typeORM auth (js to ts))

This is an example of how to use the Typescript and TypeOrm to add authentication to a NodeJS application with Express.

In this project I create an AUTH app using JWT.

I got the browser information from the session and checked if the information came from the same browser.


------------IMPORTANT!!------------
I shared the ".env" file so that you can run the project
